                I went to Kejetia to buy an outfit for a special church occasion. I didn’t have a specific thing in mind or even a picture to show. I just wanted something great to wear. I entered this shop at Adum and I reeeaaalllly regret going there. I greeted the woman and the first word from her mouth was, “wo pɛ deɛn.” ? The tone of her voice and the no-smile look she gave me, my spirit was down already. I don’t know what happened to my instinct of choice, but I never liked the product I bought. I feel like, I would’ve bought something better if she had been a little friendly with me.

                For me, I don’t know if I am just unlucky or too soft but I always feel intimidated by the women in Kejetia, lol. For this reason, I rarely go there for shopping.</p>

                I saw a nice looking suede (shoe) on Jumia. I love those kind of shoes, I even have about 7 different types and I always buy them at a boutique. This time, I decided to just try different place and online shopping sounds great. The shopping experience was good, the delivery was on time but the item... I screamed. The material was never what they described and it felt like it’s going to tear. It’s still with me and I could post the picture, but this is text only. I will try and send it to your WhatsApp number. From then, buying something online is a no no for me, lol.</p>
